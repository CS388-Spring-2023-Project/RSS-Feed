*Ideas*
 1. Create an app where the user gets a prompt/object once a day, and the user has to draw object. Everyone will get the same prompt and users can add friends to see what they drew.
 2. A statistic app that has multiple different fragment views. Each view is a different game ie. valorant, csgo, league, etc. The user can enter in their username or someone elses username on the respective game, and they see their stats in that game.
 3. A maps app where the user can map points of interest with a description. The uniqueness of the app is that users can add others as friends, and the users will be able to see each other's points of interest. Could be useful for showing others good restaurants in the area, or what the best parks are, or which places are busy/empty.

*Ideas*
1. Media review app; users can enter media that they have consumed (books, movies, games, etc) and can grade and write reviews on them.
2. A simple game app; something like Flappy Bird, though maybe something puzzle-based would be better; maybe too similar to the first project though.
3. "RSS Feed" app; users can subscribe to one or more websites, and the app will list articles that have been posted to all of them. Users can filter based on website, and tapping an article will open it on that site in their web browser.

*Ideas*
1. Top Favorite Movie Application: Similar to IMBD. User is able to view movie/tv show summary, create an account and create list of his/her favorite movie/show and can share with friends/other users on app.
2. Chat/Social Communication Application: Basic chat application similar to either messenger/messages. User is able to communicate via text messages with friend and family, another use case would be video calling.
3. Re-selling Application for tech devices: User creates account, able to post items he/she wants to sell and that item is available for view to others on application to buy. This application focuses on reselling tech devices rather than everything like other similar services like facebook marketplace. Each user account must have certain information verified to create account (Eg: Phone Number) to ensure seller is legitimate. Each item posted for sale must follow guidlines for the category of that item(Eg: Laptop: CPU, Storage, OS, RAM, etc) making it easier for customer/buyer to know exactly what they are buying.
    
## Top 3 Apps - Evaluation

### RSS Feed
   - **Description:** Users can subscribe to one or more websites, and be served a feed of articles posted to all subscribed websites. Each article has a brief description, and tapping the article opens it in the user's we browser.
   - **Category:** Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Users can conveniently access content from anywhere. Additionally, any people use their phones as their primary way to access the internet. Finally, users can see articles being posted faster if they can access the feed through their phone.
   - **Story:** Anyone who follows multiple sites will love having a centrilized feed.
   - **Market:** Anyone who follows multiple new sites, or other site that uses RSS (such as podcasts).
   - **Habit:** Users will get on consistantly to check the news and see what new articles/media have come out.
   - **Scope:** Moderate. This app relies mainly on things that we have bee taught (RecyclerViews, displaying websites, etc). The main complication is accessing APIs; if RSS doesn't have an applicable API (i.e., one that allows for updates from arbitrary sites to be tracked), the scope may have to be limited to apps that we have implemented.

### Sports Trivia
   - **Description:** Pulls data from multiple sports APIs and allows users to quiz themselves on those records and statistics. Lets users test their sports knowledge whenever they want.
   - **Category:** Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Users can share questions they have answered with other users to see if they can find the answer. Users can challenge each other to competitive trivia to see who knows more about the sports. Users can recieve a notification every day for a daily trivia question.
   - **Story:** Creates a way for people to learn more about sports and encourages them to watch more. Allows users to have fun competing against their friends and others.
   - **Market:** The market for this app would be fairly large, as billions of people around the world enjoy sports. This app would have a lot of value for people who really enjoy learning more about sports and want to test their knowledge.
   - **Habit:** Addicting because players will want to keep playing and answering new questions
   - **Scope:** Since it is a trivia app, the database of questions can be as big or as small as we want. This means that an MVP will be easy to build, and a finalized product can include more questions and more leaderboard/user interaction.

### Drawing App
   - **Description:** Each day a new prompt/object will be pushed to all users, and the users will do a drawing of the prompt. An additional feature could be adding friends to see what they draw everyday. Another feature could be a tinder feature where the user sees other users' drawings and they can like/dislike it.
   - **Category:** Art/Social
   - **Mobile:** Users will create an account and they can add other users as friends. Also, the app can detect the users' location (with consent) and show them other people's drawings in their area.
   - **Story:** Players will have the chance to look forward to getting on the app an drawing something new everyday. Friends will get to compare their drawings with one another, and players can even show off their art skills to other users local to them.
   - **Market:** Mostly marketed towards people who like to draw. However, anyone of anyage can play.
   - **Habit:** Players will want to come back everyday to see what the new prompt is. Then players will spend a minimum of 10-20 minutes on the app as they draw.
   - **Scope:** Completion of this app is totally feasable. A finished product would be a database of prompts, where one of them will be selected for that days prompt. Then many users could sign on to the app and they will all see that prompt. They will all be able to draw their own picture on their own mobile device. Lastly, players can friend other players by username and see what they drew. A MVP for this app would just be the prompt and the drawing of the image.

## Final Selected Idea: RSS Feed
